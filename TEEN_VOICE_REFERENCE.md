## Authenticity Tips

### What Makes It Real

1. **Inconsistency** - Real kids don't have perfect grammar
2. **Emotion** - Posts reflect genuine feelings
3. **Context** - Posts respond to actual events
4. **Personality** - Voice matches character consistently
5. **Trends** - Uses current (2024-2025) slang appropriately

### What to Avoid

1. ❌ Perfect grammar and spelling
2. ❌ Adult vocabulary ("indeed", "furthermore", "consequently")
3. ❌ Overly thoughtful/deep posts (unless studious personality)
4. ❌ No emoji (except shy students)
5. ❌ Outdated slang ("yolo", "swag", "bae")

### Age-Appropriate Considerations

**5th graders (10-11 years old) are:**
- Still learning internet culture
- Less edgy than middle schoolers
- More earnest, less ironic
- Still excited about "basic" things
- Not fully fluent in all current slang

**Keep posts:**
- School-appropriate
- Innocent in nature
- Enthusiastic about small things
- Socially focused (friends, events, feelings)
- Less cynical than older teens

## Integration Checklist

When integrating into your game:

- [ ] Pass actual student relationships for friend mentions
- [ ] Set mood based on recent game events
- [ ] Set energy based on time of day (morning = low, lunch = high)
- [ ] Include recent event context when applicable
- [ ] Filter by personality for posting frequency
- [ ] Show timestamps for realistic feed chronology
- [ ] Allow reactions/comments for engagement
- [ ] Update feed dynamically as game progresses

## Testing Your Integration

Good signs your integration is working:

✅ **Voice variety** - Different students sound different
✅ **Context awareness** - Posts reference actual game events
✅ **Mood variation** - Energy/caps match game state
✅ **Relationship mentions** - Students mention actual friends
✅ **Frequency variance** - Shy students post less than outgoing
✅ **Template diversity** - Not seeing same template repeatedly

Red flags:

🚩 All students sound the same
🚩 Posts don't relate to game events
🚩 Same emoji on every post
🚩 No friend mentions despite relationships
🚩 All students posting at same rate
🚩 Generic/bland content
